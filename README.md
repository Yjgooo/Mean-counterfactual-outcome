By checking the plot, one can see that the estimator 1 has the best performance in terms of MSE. This is not surprising, as OLS is the BLUE (and the same holds for any linear combination of the coefficients). 

Estimator 2 and 3 perform very similarly. Meaning that in this specific setting the estimation of g(W) = P(A = 1|W) costs us very little.
